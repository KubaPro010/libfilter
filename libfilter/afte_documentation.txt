AFTE (Audio Frequency Time Encoding) is a encoding for modulating time, into RF or FM subcarriers

1. Modulation

Every AFTE broadcast will modulated in FM (not including broadcast FM subcarriers), a AFTE broadcast alone will use a 20-2000 Hz band to encode a 4-FSK signals, we'll refer to this signal as the LS:

00: 200 Hz
01: 1200 Hz
11: 1600 Hz
10: 2000 Hz
(RST: 500 hz)

Afterwards on 3000 Hz, you'll have a QPSK Pilot, twice the frequency (6000 Hz) you'll have the QPSK signal, here are the phases (diffrence from pilot, in degrees), we'll refer to this signal as HS:
00: +0
01: +90
11: +270
10: +180

Afterwards there's gonna be a signal on 6500 Hz which is gonna trigger every second, like the GTS pips, we'll be reffer to this as STS:
0.9 seconds: nothing
0.1 seconds: 6.5 KHz tone
...

Then we'll have another signal, on 7000 KHz which is gonna be the SSTS, it will trigger every half second, so:
0.4 seconds: nothing
0.1 seconds: 7 KHz tone
0.4 seconds: nothing
0.1 seconds: 7 KHz tone
...

2. Encoding
2-1: LS

The LS signal should encode the current time, as in hour, minute, second (local), every RST signal represents a reset in the message, so it looks like this:

RST
(6 bits representing the hour, zero prefix, so last 5 bits represent the hour)
(6 bits representing the minute)
(6 bits representing the second)
...

2-2: HS

(6 bits for year transmission, years since 2024, so for 2030 it will be 6 here, zero prefix, so last 5 is used)
(4 bits for month transmission, 0-12)
(6 bits for day-in-month transmission, 1-31, zero prefix so last 5 are used)
(4 bits for UTC offset in 30 minute intervals, so if now it is 12:30 locally and 11:00 UTC, then it is gonna be 3 here)


Frequencies used:
- 200-2000 Hz: LS
- 3000 Hz: QPSK Pilot
- 6000 Hz: QPSK signal
- 6500 Hz: Second time signal (STS)
- 7000 Hz: Sub Second time signal (SSTS)
